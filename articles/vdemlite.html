<p><code>vdemlite</code> incorporates data for 297 variables V-Dem
indices and indicators from 1970 to the present and is organized around
the structure of aggregation outlined in <a href="https://v-dem.net/documents/41/v-dem_structureofaggregation_v14.pdf" class="external-link">this
document</a> and in Appendix A of the <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/documents/38/V-Dem_Codebook_v14.pdf" class="external-link">V-Dem
Codebook</a>. It includes all of the indicators included in this
document plus a few background factors and additional commonly-used
indicators. The dataset covers 1970 to the present and includes all
countries in the V-Dem dataset.</p>
<p>There are three primary functions in the <code>vdemlite</code>
package: - <code><a href="../reference/fetchdem.html">fetchdem()</a></code> provides functionality for
downloading V-Dem data included in <code>vdemlite</code> and loads it
into R. - <code><a href="../reference/summarizedem.html">summarizedem()</a></code> provides an interactive table of
summary statistics of the data and, for smaller queries, some capacity
for visualization. - <code><a href="../reference/searchdem.html">searchdem()</a></code> function returns an
interactive, searchable table of the dataset.</p>
<p>You can install the latest version of <code>vdemlite</code> from
GitHub using the <code>pak</code> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>Alternatively, you could use the <code>remotes</code> package or the
<code>devtools</code> package:</p>

<p>The main function in <code>vdemlite</code> is
<code><a href="../reference/fetchdem.html">fetchdem()</a></code>, which can be used to query the
<code>vdemlite</code> dataset and retrieve data for specific indicators,
groups of indicators, years, and countries. The function returns a data
frame with the requested data.</p>

<p>Simply calling <code><a href="../reference/fetchdem.html">fetchdem()</a></code> will return the entire
<code>vdemlite</code> dataset. But <code><a href="../reference/fetchdem.html">fetchdem()</a></code> takes up to
five arguments that allow the user to conduct more targeted queries:
<code>indicators</code>, <code>start_year</code>, <code>end_year</code>,
<code>countries</code>, and <code>wide</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>indicators</code> argument is a character vector of V-Dem
indicator codes but also groups of variables such as “big_5” (for the
five main high-level democracy indexes) or “v2x_libdem_all” (for all of
the indices and indicators used in the construction of the liberal
democracy index.</p>
<p>The <code>start_year</code> and <code>end_year</code> arguments
specify the range of years to fetch data for. The <code>countries</code>
argument is a character vector of three-digit <a href="https://www.iban.com/country-codes" class="external-link">iso3c</a> country codes. The
<code>wide</code> argument specifies whether to return the data in wide
format (the default) or long format.</p>

<h3 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#basic-usage"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s say you wanted to get the Polyarchy score for all countries for
the years 1980-2020. You could do this by setting
<code>indicators</code> to <code>v2x_polyarchy</code> and
<code>start_year</code> and <code>end_year</code> to 1980 and 2020,
respectively.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>We can add indicators to our desired list or filter for specific
countries by using the combine function (<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html" class="external-link">c()</a></code>). For example,
if you wanted to get the polyarchy and clean elections index for the USA
and Sweden, you could set <code>indicators</code> to
<code>c("v2x_polyarchy", "v2xel_frefair")</code> and
<code>countries</code> to <code>c("USA", "SWE")</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>By default, <code><a href="../reference/fetchdem.html">fetchdem()</a></code> returns the data in wide format.
However, you can also return the data in long format by setting the
<code>wide</code> argument to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>

<h3 id="querying-groups-of-indicators">Querying Groups of Indicators<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#querying-groups-of-indicators"></a>
</h3>
<p><code><a href="../reference/fetchdem.html">fetchdem()</a></code> can also be used to retrieve groups of
indexes and indicators that follow the structure of aggregation outlined
in Appendix A of the V-Dem Codebook.</p>
<p>Setting indicators to <code>big_5</code> will retrieve the five main
high-level indices for all countries and years.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># Five main high-level indices for all countries and years in long format</span></span>

<p>There are also groupings available for the high-level, mid-level, and
lower-level indices. For example, you could get all of the high-level
indices for all countries in 2015 like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># All high-level indices for all countries in 2015</span></span>
<span><span class="va">high_level_2015</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/fetchdem.html">fetchdem</a></span><span class="op">(</span>indicators <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"high_level"</span>,</span>
<span>                        start_year <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">2015</span>, end_year <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">2015</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, for low-level and mid-level indices you would specify
<code>indicators = "low_level"</code> or
<code>indicators = "mid_level"</code>.</p>
<p>One useful bit of information for leveraging this functionality is
that in V-Dem, indexes start with the prefix <code>v2x_</code>.
<code>vdemlite</code> leverages this structure to enable the user to
retrieve all of the indices and indicators that are used in the
construction of a particular index.</p>
<p>Specifically, you can retrieve all of the indices and indicators that
are used in the construction of a particular index code by adding suffix
<code>_all</code> to an index code. For example, to get all of the
indicators that comprise the liberal democracy index for India, you
would set <code>indicators</code> to <code>v2x_libdem_all</code> and
<code>countries</code> to <code>IND</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># Indicators that comprise the liberal democracy index for India, all years</span></span>

<span>                            countries <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"IND"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, you can get all of the indicators that comprise the
Regimes of the World index for Venezuela by setting
<code>indicators</code> to <code>v2x_regime_all</code> and
<code>countries</code> to <code>VEN</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># Indicators that comprise the Regimes of the World index for Venezuela, all years</span></span>

<p>There are some additional categories not included in the construction
of indicators that are also included in <code>vdemlite</code> including
<code>legitimation</code>, <code>civic_space</code>,
<code>mass_mobilization</code>, <code>citizen_engagement</code>,
<code>academic_space</code> and <code>background</code> (for background
factors).</p>
<p>Let’s grab the background factors and polyarchy index for all

<p>Sometimes you might be curious to know about the coverage of a given
index of indicator and to get a quick look at how the data look for
individual countries. For this, <code>vdemlite</code> includes a
function called <code><a href="../reference/summarizedem.html">summarizedem()</a></code> that provides an

<p>The table is based on the <a href="https://v-dem.net/documents/41/v-dem_structureofaggregation_v14.pdf" class="external-link">Structure
of V-Dem Indices, Components and Indicators</a> document and includes
four columns: the variable tag; the index or indicator descriptor; the
level of the index or indicator (high-level index, mid-level index,
lower-level index; or indicator); and a column called “Part” that
distinguishes between V-Dem Indicators and Indices (part 1) and indices
created using V-Dem data (part 2).</p>
<p>The default behavior is to return all indices and their descriptions
but does have an argument <code>index</code> that is a character vector
of indices or indicators. If a value for <code>index</code> is provided,
the function will return any sub-indices and indicators used to
construct the selected indices. For example
<code>searchdem("v2x_libdem")</code> would return all of the sub-indices
and indicators used to construct the polyarchy score.</p>
<p>It is not possible to specify the groups of indicators that can be
used in the <code><a href="../reference/fetchdem.html">fetchdem()</a></code> function, e.g. <code>big5</code>,
<code>v2x_libdem_all</code>, etc. in the <code>indices</code> argument.
However, you can search for the “level” groupings
(e.g. <code>high_level</code>, <code>mid_level</code> and
<code>lower_level</code>) in the table itself.</p>
